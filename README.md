# Plants vs. Zombies: Heroes test app

Simple web app to try out user modified cards to improve game play from the current PvZ from PopCap/EA.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github/brianyamasaki/pvzhu
cd pvzhu

npm start
```

## Motivation

Some players still like the game PvZ: Heroes, but EA isn't putting any time or money into updating the game. So why not create a fan game that allows the same gameplay, minus some of the art and animation?

## Thank you

I hope this template will be helpful for you and you will love using it ðŸ–¤
